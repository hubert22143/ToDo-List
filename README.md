ToDo List
This is a simple task management app I built while working through The Odin Project curriculum. 
It's a single-page application (SPA) where users can add, update, and delete tasks, with data organized by project.

Features
- Create tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority

- Organize tasks into different projects

- Edit and delete tasks or entire projects

- Mark tasks as complete

- Local storage support to persist tasks between sessions

Technologies:
JavaScript (ES6 modules)

HTML & CSS

Webpack

Project Structure
/src contains all the main modules:

index.js: App entry point, initializes the UI and loads existing tasks

task.js: Task factory function and task-related logic

project.js: Handles creating and storing projects

ui.js: Updates DOM elements, handles event listeners

storage.js: Reads from and writes to localStorage

How the Code Works
createTask(title, description, dueDate, priority)
A factory function that returns a task object with the above properties.

addTaskToProject(projectName, task)
Adds a new task to the specified projectâ€™s task array.

deleteTask(projectName, taskId)
Removes a task by ID from the specified project.

createProject(name)
Returns a project object with a name and empty task array.

saveToLocalStorage() and loadFromLocalStorage()
Handle data persistence using the browser's localStorage.

renderProjectList() and renderTaskList(project)
Update the visible project and task lists based on current app state.
